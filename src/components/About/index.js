            Hello, my name is Nate Johnson and I decided to make the move of
            becoming a full-stack web developer after 10 years in the insurance
            industy. I have attended the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp
            with the goal of working as a software developer. I enjoy
            technology, and I am looking forwarding to using my past experiences
            in a new career as a web developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            My prior experience has prepared me well for the attention to detail
            required in software development, as well as, the team work and
            problem solving skills required to be a great developer. I enjoy
            continuous learning and staying up-to-date on current and emerging
            technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy photography, traveling, and studying
            classical languages, literature, and past cultures of antiquity.
            Below you can view my LinkedIn page and GitHub page to learn a
            little bit more about me. Thank you for visiting, and see the
